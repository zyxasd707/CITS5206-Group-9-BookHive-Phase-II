# 📚 Bookhive Deployment Guide

## 🚀 How to Start

### Production (VPS)
```bash
make up
```
- Deploys using `compose.yaml` + `compose.prod.yaml`
- Runs with HTTPS (TLS via Certbot) and security block rules enabled
- Accessible at: `https://bookborrow.org`

### Development (Local)
```bash
make up-dev
```
- Deploys using `compose.yaml` + `compose.dev.yaml`
- No TLS, no block rules (simplified for local testing)
- Accessible at: `http://localhost`

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (required in all environments)  
- **make** (for simplified commands)

### Installing `make`

#### macOS
```bash
brew install make
```
(macOS may already include `make`; check with `make --version`.)

#### Windows
1. Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)  
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator  
   - Run:  
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; `
     [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = `
     [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; `
     iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
     ```

2. Install make:  
   ```powershell
   choco install make
   ```

3. Restart the terminal and confirm:  
   ```powershell
   make --version
   ```

---

## 📝 Notes
- The `.env` file is **not committed** – each environment must create and maintain its own.
- Certificates (`nginx/letsencrypt/`) and logs are **VPS-only** and must never be pushed to GitHub.
- Development does not require HTTPS (use `http://localhost`).
- ⚠️ **PLEASE DO NOT PUSH ANY CODES FROM THE PRODUCTION SERVER**  
  Production is managed **only via GitHub Actions**.  
  Manual edits or commits made directly on the VPS will break deployment consistency.
