# 📚 Bookhive Deployment Guide

## 🚀 How to Start

### Production (VPS)
```bash
make up
```
- Deploys using `compose.yaml` + `compose.prod.yaml`
- Runs with HTTPS (TLS via Certbot) and security block rules enabled
- Accessible at: `https://bookborrow.org`

### Development (Local)
```bash
make up-dev
```
- Deploys using `compose.yaml` + `compose.dev.yaml`
- No TLS, no block rules (simplified for local testing)
- Accessible at: `http://localhost`

---

## 🖥️ Local Development Setup (Windows / Without `make`)

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running
- Git installed

### Step 1 — Configure `.env`

Copy the example file and fill in the values:

```powershell
cp .env.example .env
```

Minimum required values for local development:

```env
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=123456
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=BookHive

SECRET_KEY=<any-random-string-32-chars-or-more>
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

# Placeholder values — email/payment won't work locally, but the app will start
BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-local-dev-placeholder-key-not-real
BREVO_KEY_TYPE=api-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_local_dev_placeholder_not_real

# Must include http://localhost to avoid CORS errors
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://localhost,http://127.0.0.1
```

### Step 2 — Start Docker Desktop

Open Docker Desktop and wait until the icon in the system tray is stable (not spinning). This takes ~1–2 minutes.

### Step 3 — Build and start (first time only)

```powershell
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml up --build
```

### Step 4 — Wait for startup

Startup is complete when you see both lines:

```
fastapi-backend  | INFO:     Application startup complete.
next-frontend    |  ✓ Ready in ...ms
```

### Step 5 — Open in browser

| URL | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `http://localhost` | Frontend (main entry point) |
| `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs` | Backend API docs |

---

### Daily startup (after first time)

```powershell
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml up
```

### Stop the project

```powershell
# Stop but keep database data
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml down

# Stop and delete database data (full reset)
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml down -v
```

---

### Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine` | Docker Desktop not running | Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to be ready |
| `Conflict. The container name already in use` | Stale containers from previous run | Run `docker compose ... down` then retry |
| `ports are not available: 3306` | Local MySQL occupying port 3306 | Already handled — config uses `3307:3306` |
| `Missing BREVO_API_KEY` | `.env` not configured | Follow Step 1 above |
| `CORS policy blocked` | `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` missing `http://localhost` | Add `http://localhost` to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env` |
| `localhost:3000 refused` | Port 3000 not exposed to host | Access `http://localhost` (no port number) |

**Full reset (when nothing else works):**

```powershell
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml down -v
docker rm -f fastapi-backend next-frontend nginx-proxy mysql-db
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.dev.yaml up --build
```

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (required in all environments)  
- **make** (for simplified commands)

### Installing `make`

#### macOS
```bash
brew install make
```
(macOS may already include `make`; check with `make --version`.)

#### Windows
1. Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)  
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator  
   - Run:  
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; `
     [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = `
     [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; `
     iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
     ```

2. Install make:  
   ```powershell
   choco install make
   ```

3. Restart the terminal and confirm:  
   ```powershell
   make --version
   ```

## 📝 Notes
- The `.env` file is **not committed** – each environment must create and maintain its own.
- Certificates (`nginx/letsencrypt/`) and logs are **VPS-only** and must never be pushed to GitHub.
- Development does not require HTTPS (use `http://localhost`).
- ⚠️ **PLEASE DO NOT PUSH ANY CODES FROM THE PRODUCTION SERVER**  
  Production is managed **only via GitHub Actions**.  
  Manual edits or commits made directly on the VPS will break deployment consistency.

---

## 🔧 Useful Commands

### Production
```bash
make up        # start containers in production mode
make down      # stop containers
make build     # rebuild containers
make logs      # follow logs (nginx, frontend, backend)
```

### Development
```bash
make up-dev    # start containers in development mode
make down-dev  # stop containers
make build-dev # rebuild containers
make logs-dev  # follow logs (nginx, frontend, backend)
```

### Clean-up
